## Branching Workflow
- Create branches from `dev`.
- Use `feature/[feature-name]` for new features.
- Use `bugfix/[issue]` for bug fixes.
- Once stable, `dev` is merged into `main`.

## Pull Requests
1. Create your branch from `dev`.
2. Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages.
3. Open a PR into `dev`.
4. Request at least one reviewer.
5. After review and testing, PRs can be merged into `dev`.

## Issues
- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and features.
- Apply labels such as `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `AI-integration`.

## Communication
- Major design discussions should happen on the Project Board.
- Be respectful in all PR reviews and discussions.
