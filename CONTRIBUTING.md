## Branching Workflow
- Create branches from `main`.
- Use `feature/[short-feature-name]` for new features.
- Use `fix/[issue-number-or-description]` for bug fixes.
- Once stable, feature branches are merged into `main`.

## Pull Requests
1. Create your branch from `main`.
2. Commit changes with **clear, descriptive messages** (see below).
3. Push your branch and open a **Pull Request** into `main`.
4. Request at least one reviewer.
5. Ensure all checks/tests pass before merging.

## Issues
- Use GitHub Issues and regularly check the Jira board to track tasks, bugs, and features.
- Apply labels such as `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `AI-integration`.
- Reference issues in commits and PRs (e.g., `Fixes #42`).

## Communication
- Major design discussions should happen in-person or over group chats on other platforms.
- Keep the team informed about major updates or feedback gained from stakeholder interviews.
- Be respectful in all PR reviews and discussions.
